Welcome to the LeetCode and Data Challenge exercises. We will release 3 coding challenges and 1 data challenge per week for next three weeks. Please spend no more than 1 hour per Leetcode question and 4 hours for data challenge problem. 

Downloading the Github repo:

For the first time ONLY, please follow these steps:
1. `$ mkdir FOLDER_NAME` #create a folder under a directry 
2. `$ cd FOLDER_NAME` # enter to the folder you just created
2. `$ git clone GIT_REPO_URL` #download the git repo from https://github.com/xbzheng/insight_bos_coding_challenges.git

Moving forward, you only need to run `$ git pull` to get most up-to-date files


Submitting your LeetCode solutions to repo:

1. `$ cd problem_*)` #you will see the question written in Python format. For example, cd problem_1, the question file is named linked_list.py

2. Make a copy of this question file and move to "Fellow Codes Go Here" folder, and rename the question file to your name. For example, mine would be ivan_zheng.py. Please note that, since the autograder takes the files from "Fellow Codes Go Here" foder, it is critical that you follow this instruction. 

3. Remeber to commit your code when you are done. 

Submitting your data challenge solutions to repo:

1. Code and annotate your analysis in a Jupyter notebook

2. Save it to the `dc_go_here` folder, with the naming convention "First_Last_DataChallenge1.ipynb".  For example, mine is ivan_zheng_DataChallenge1.ipynb

Have fun!
