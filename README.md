Welcome to the LeetCode challenge, I will release 3 coding challenges per week for next three weeks. Please spend no more than 1 hour per question. 

Downloading the Github repo:

For the first time ONLY, please follow these steps:
1. `$ mkdir FOLDER_NAME` #create a folder under a directry 
2. `$ cd FOLDER_NAME` # enter to the folder you just created
2. `$ git clone GIT_REPO_URL` #download the git repo from https://github.com/xbzheng/insight_bos_coding_challenges.git

Moving forward, you only need to run `$ git pull` to get most up-to-date files


Submitting your solution to repo:

1. `$ cd problem_*)` #you will see the question written in Python format. For example, cd problem_1, the question file is named linked_list.py

2. Make a copy of this question file and move to "Fellow Codes Go Here" folder, and rename the question file to your name. For example, mine would be ivan_zheng.py. Please note that, since the autograder takes the files from "Fellow Codes Go Here" foder, it is critical that you follow this instruction. 

3. Remeber to commit your code when you are done. 


Have fun coding~~
